### **1. `scripts/setup-runner.sh`**

**Before:**
```bash
RUNNER_VERSION="2.311.0"
# No SHA256 verification
```

**After:**
```bash
# Latest runner version (as of 2025-10-14)
# Check for updates at: https://github.com/actions/runner/releases
RUNNER_VERSION="2.329.0"
RUNNER_FILE="actions-runner-linux-x64-${RUNNER_VERSION}.tar.gz"
RUNNER_SHA256="194f1e1e4bd02f80b7e9633fc546084d8d4e19f3928a324d512ea53430102e1d"

# Verify SHA256 checksum for security
echo "Verifying checksum..."
echo "$RUNNER_SHA256  $RUNNER_FILE" | sha256sum --check

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Downloaded and verified"
else
    echo "❌ ERROR: Checksum verification failed!"
    echo "   The downloaded file may be corrupted or tampered with."
    echo "   Removing file..."
    rm -f "$RUNNER_FILE"
